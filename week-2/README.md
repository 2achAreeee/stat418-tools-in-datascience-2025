# Week 2

## Week Overview

Discuss docker a bit more with some additional implementation. Discuss some GitHub.

We will also start to talk about the Unix operating system. To introduce the shell means to have a discussion about the structure of the computer, operating systems, file systems and history. The shell offers programmatic access to a computer’s underlying parts, providing the ability to “do” data analysis on directories, on processes, and on their networks.
